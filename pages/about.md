**/foh**-k _uh_ s/ (Focus) is a beautiful focus timer to help you get shit done.

---

## Why 
I came across the <a href="https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique" target="_blank">Pomodoro TechniqueÂ©</a> a while back and found it to be very effective in helping me stay on task and knock out work.

I also wanted to learn more about Electron and actually ship a side project. 

I combined the two and that's how **/foh**-k _uh_ s/ was born.

<br />

## Tech

The app itself is written with vanilla JavaScript using <a href="https://electron.atom.io/" target="_blank">Electron</a>

This site is created using <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>, a React.js static site generator and is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>

The release server is created using Node.js, Express, and <a href="https://nuts.gitbook.com/" target="_blank">Nuts</a>. It is deployed using <a href="https://zeit.co/now" target="_blank">Now</a>
<br />
<br />

If you are interested in using the Pomodoro TechniqueÂ©, but from the command line, I have created a tiny module called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-shit-done" target="_blank">Get Shit Done</a>
<br />
<br />
